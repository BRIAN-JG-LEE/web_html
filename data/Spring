    222We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries
    so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need
    minimal Spring configuration. If you’re looking for information about a
    specific version, or instructions about how to upgrade from an earlier
    release, check out the project release notes section on our wiki.
